How to Customize:

Computer Name: Enter the desired new computer name when prompted.
User Name: Enter the desired new user name when prompted.
If you want to hard-code the names without the prompt, replace: 
set /p newComputerName="Enter new computer name: " and set /p newUserName="Enter new user name: " with the values directly like so:

set newComputerName=NewPCName
set newUserName=NewUserName
